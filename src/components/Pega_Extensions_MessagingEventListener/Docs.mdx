# Overview

The `MessagingEventListener` is a template component designed to register for specific events from the messaging server. When a message is received, it triggers a refresh of the current form/assignment to ensure the UI is in sync with server-side state or external updates.

As a template, it acts as a wrapper, allowing developers to insert nested views or fields that will be re-rendered upon the refresh event.
