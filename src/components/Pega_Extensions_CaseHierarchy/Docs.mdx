# Overview

The Case Hierarchy Widget allows to display a tree representation of the parent-child relationship for the current case as a utility widget in the Case View.
It is possible to show the top level parent of the current case and the complete tree.

Important note: This component will be provided out-of-the-box in Pega 25.1 and will be removed from the master branch once the UI Gallery is upgraded to support 25.1.
